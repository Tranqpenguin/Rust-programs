This programming assignment was worked on by Adrian Sicaju Ruiz and Andre Quiroa. We had recieved a lot of help through classmates wihtin
the discord server that the TA Connor had created for us to ask questions when we needed help. Since Rust is a foreign language to us, we 
needed alot of help on syntax such as how crates work, how we are able to use this libraries functions and what more we can do with it.
We were mostly guided by the professors instructions and suggestions of what other classmates did that worked for them and what we could try.
In brightness, we were able to successfully implement parts of the code the professor had provided and work around, same thing with the
pnmdata lab which was similar to what we were trying to do. Obstacles with that is we had trouble of figuring out how to access each pixel
to perform the calculations to get the average brightness value. Couple things that we had trouble implementing was mainly a lot of syntax
errors that were able to be fixed by guidance through the TA's Connor and Isaac. Same thing with our fgroups. We kept having trouble to 
figure out how to give in standard input in the terminal. We would say it took us a total of 15 hours+ total time on the code itself to 
complete because a lot was reading documentation and trying to understand the syntax of Rust.

PART C:
A list of problems that can be solved with a working version of fgroups 
-	can be identification during crime scenes. Fingerprints can be the leading evidence to 
    identify a person who can be associated with the crime scene and can be found within a database of fingerprints

-	Providing security for authorized only access for a room or building

-	Providing security on personal devices such as laptops, phones, and tablets so only the owner is allowed access through a fingerprint
    There are many useful things you can do with a fingerprint to provide security and to seek information associated with a person.
